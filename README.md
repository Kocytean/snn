__Discretised Spike Response Model__

Deep spiking neural network using Numpy

- Axonal weights and delays
- Seperate implementations for neuron dynamics and network routing
- Designed for experimention with neuron simulation methods and learning algorithms
- Focus on analysis/diagnosis rather than speed 

WIP: 
- Seperating implementation of initialisation distributions of network dynamics/routing parameters
- Suite of optimization tools
